# PySpark Learning Repository

Welcome to my PySpark learning repository! This repository is a work in progress and is intended to document my journey into the world of data engineering using PySpark.

## About This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning as I explore PySpark data frames and machine learning models.

## Repository Contents

At present, the repository contains:

- Jupyter Notebooks exploring PySpark data frames and their functionality
- Basic PySpark scripts demonstrating data transformation and manipulation
- An initial PySpark machine learning model to predict song tempo and danceability

As I continue to learn and explore PySpark, I will be updating this repository with new data frames, models, and insights.

## How to Use This Repository

If you're interested in learning PySpark and exploring data engineering, feel free to explore the code and models in this repository. I encourage you to fork the repository and use it as a starting point for your own PySpark projects.

## Conclusion

I'm excited to continue learning PySpark and exploring the world of data engineering. I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for others who are also embarking on this journey. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out!
